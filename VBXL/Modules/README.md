# Modules

Static modules created for easing VBA development.

I tried to decouple these modules as much as I could for individual classes or modules to be usable.
- There may still be dependencies since some classes work better with some modules.
- e.g. The [FileSystem.cls](/VBXL/Classes/FileSystem/FileSystem.cls) class works well with the [Environment.bas](/VBXL/Modules/Environment/Environment.bas) module for easy path access.
