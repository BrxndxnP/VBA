# FileSystem

A late-binding wrapper class for the `Scripting.FileSystemObject` object.

Allows using the `Scripting.FileSystemObject` object with intellisense without having to add a reference.
- Other users may not have the `Scripting` library added in their Visual Basic Editor. 
- This will alleviate that issue by using late-binding.

Recommended to be used in conjunction with the [Environment.bas](../../../Excel/Modules/Environment/Environment.bas) module for easier file path access.
